This project aims at building a database system that manages the relationships  between customers and salesmen in a certain company.

User interface description:
Using JDBC, NetBeans and java swing library, a graphical user interface was implemented for each table in our database. A user may insert new values into each table, delete current values in each table and update current values in each table. In addition, all data will be displayed for the user in the form of a table, and they are updated once an action is performed. For instance, any insertion, deletion or updating will lead this table to be updated accordingly. An example is provided in Figure 1 where a user can insert, update and delete values from the USER table and view the data available in the table.
